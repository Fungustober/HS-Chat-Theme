     <p>You are an internet user, looking for a nice theme to spruce up your discord client with. Whether on purpose, or by accident, you have come upon this page, and now you are at a crossroads.</p> 
     <p>You can either leave, and never experience having your discord client look like you stumbled out of sburb, or you can delve deeper and discover more of what this theme has to offer.</p>
     <p>Some of you, though, may walk a third path, only obtaining the theme I made that makes your Discord use the font Courier Prime without all the other visual changes from HS Chat Theme.</p>
     <p>Your fate is in your own hands.</p>
