     <p>You are an internet user, looking for a nice theme to spruce up your discord client with. Whether on purpose, or by accident, you have come upon this page, and now you are at a crossroads.</p> 
     <p>You can either leave, and never experience having your discord client look like you stumbled out of sburb, or you can use this theme with BetterDiscord to be immersed into a fictional world. If you do the latter, I also suggest pairing it with Zerebos's <a href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BetterRoleColors">BetterRoleColors</a> plugin. for that extra bit of Homestuck</p>
     <p>Some of you, though, may walk a third path, only obtaining the theme I made that makes your Discord use the font Courier Prime without all the other visual changes from HS Chat Theme.</p>
     <p>Your fate is in your own hands.</p>
